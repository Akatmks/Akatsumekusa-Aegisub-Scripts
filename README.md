AAE Export is a Blender add-on that exports tracks and plane tracks into [Aegisub-Motion](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/Aegisub-Motion/) and [Aegisub-Perspective-Motion](https://github.com/Zahuczky/Zahuczkys-Aegisub-Scripts/tree/daily_stream) compatible AAE data.

For anyone who is interested, there is also a [more complex script](https://github.com/Akatmks/Non-Carbonated-Motion) in development. There is no guarantee when that script will be finished but hope it will come sooner rather than later.
