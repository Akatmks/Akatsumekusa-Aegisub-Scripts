### Summary: Install AAE Export

* At Blender splash screen, select VFX startup file and you will get a workspace that's pretty much ready for motion tracking. The most important editors for motion tracking are „Movie Clip Editor > Tracking > Clip“ editor and „Movie Clip Editor > Tracking > Graph“ editor.
* Once you've set up your workspace, you can save a copy of your Blender file so you can keep the new workspace next time you open Blender. You can also set it as Blender's default startup file at „File > Defaults > Save Startup File“.
* At the menu bar, click „Edit > Preference“, and then in the „Add-ons“ section, click the „Install“ button and select `aae-export.py` to install AAE Export.
